/*DEFINING A FUNCTION USING FUNCTION DECLARATION*/
/*The most common way of to define a function is by use of a function declaration.*/

function myName(){
    console.log("Miriam");
}

/*"myName" is a pointer to some stored, potential, not yet actually run bit of work
(the function). The pointer is used to call, invoke or execute the function. We call/invoke 
a function by adding () after the pointer"*/


function myName(){
    console.log("Miriam")
}
myName();
